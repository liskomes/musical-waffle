Notes:
1. It's not good that a reserver user can change the reserver to whoever he/she wants
2. Changing the reservation end time to smaller than start time throws an error
3. Quest can add new resources if he/she goes directly to resources page
4. Reserver can see all reservation forms even he/she is not the reserver when he/she goes directly to the page (e.g. http://localhost:8000/reservation?id=3). 
5. Not implemented
6. Quest can see empty form, but can't save anything
7. Reserver cannot go to edit page via normal way, but can edit resources when he/she goes directly to the edit page
